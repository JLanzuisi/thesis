	abstract = {This paper contributes to the theory of large cardinals beyond the Kunen inconsistency, or choiceless large cardinal axioms, in the context where the Axiom of Choice is not assumed. The first part of the paper investigates a periodicity phenomenon: assuming choiceless large cardinal axioms, the properties of the cumulative hierarchy turn out to alternate between even and odd ranks. The second part of the paper explores the structure of ultrafilters under choiceless large cardinal axioms, exploiting the fact that these axioms imply a weak form of the author's Ultrapower Axiom. The third and final part of the paper examines the consistency strength of choiceless large cardinals, including a proof that assuming {DC}, the existence of an elementary embedding from \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+3\}\$ to \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+3\}\$ implies the consistency of {ZFC} + \$I\_0\$. By a recent result of Schlutzenberg, an elementary embedding from \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+2\}\$ to \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+2\}\$ does not suffice.},

For example, there is no elementary embedding from the universe V to a set-forcing extension V[G], or conversely from V[G] to V, or more generally from one set-forcing ground model of the universe to another, or between any two models that are eventually stationary correct, or from V to {HOD}, or conversely from {HOD} to V, or indeed from any definable class to V, among many other possibilities we consider, including generic embeddings, definable embeddings and results not requiring the axiom of choice. We have aimed in this article for a unified presentation that weaves together some previously known unpublished or folklore results, several due to Woodin and others, along with our new contributions.},
