	abstract = {This chapter reports on some meta-mathematical results obtained by William P. Hanf (as a solution of a problem suggested by the author) and some mathematical problems involving inaccessible cardinals for which a partial solution are found recently. As a theoretical basis for the discussion, the chapter selects one of the well known axiomatic systems of set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel system (with the regularity axiom) or the Bernays system. Numerous problems in set theory and related domains are well known. Each of the problems consists in determining all the (infinite) cardinals that have a given property P. It is known that the smallest infinite cardinal, ω, does not have this property. It has also been known that all the accessible cardinals—for example, all those that are not inaccessible have the property P. It seems that the solution of the problem for inaccessible cardinals may require an introduction of some new set-theoretical axioms that could differ in their character not only from the usual axioms of set theory but also from the generalized continuum hypothesis or various existential hypotheses that assure the existence of inaccessible cardinals. The significance of many problems that are included in the chapter is enhanced by the simplicity of their formulation and the clarity of their mathematical content.},

The first part of the paper investigates a periodicity phenomenon: assuming choiceless large cardinal axioms, the properties of the cumulative hierarchy turn out to alternate between even and odd ranks. The second part of the paper explores the structure of ultrafilters under choiceless large cardinal axioms, exploiting the fact that these axioms imply a weak form of the author's Ultrapower Axiom. The third and final part of the paper examines the consistency strength of choiceless large cardinals, including a proof that assuming {DC}, the existence of an elementary embedding from \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+3\}\$ to \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+3\}\$ implies the consistency of {ZFC} + \$I\_0\$. By a recent result of Schlutzenberg, an elementary embedding from \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+2\}\$ to \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+2\}\$ does not suffice.},
