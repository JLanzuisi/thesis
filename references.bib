	abstract = {This chapter reports on some meta-mathematical results obtained by William P. Hanf (as a solution of a problem suggested by the author) and some mathematical problems involving inaccessible cardinals for which a partial solution are found recently. As a theoretical basis for the discussion, the chapter selects one of the well known axiomatic systems of set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel system (with the regularity axiom) or the Bernays system. Numerous problems in set theory and related domains are well known. Each of the problems consists in determining all the (infinite) cardinals that have a given property P. It is known that the smallest infinite cardinal, ω, does not have this property. It has also been known that all the accessible cardinals—for example, all those that are not inaccessible have the property P. It seems that the solution of the problem for inaccessible cardinals may require an introduction of some new set-theoretical axioms that could differ in their character not only from the usual axioms of set theory but also from the generalized continuum hypothesis or various existential hypotheses that assure the existence of inaccessible cardinals. The significance of many problems that are included in the chapter is enhanced by the simplicity of their formulation and the clarity of their mathematical content.},

The first part of the paper investigates a periodicity phenomenon: assuming choiceless large cardinal axioms, the properties of the cumulative hierarchy turn out to alternate between even and odd ranks. The second part of the paper explores the structure of ultrafilters under choiceless large cardinal axioms, exploiting the fact that these axioms imply a weak form of the author's Ultrapower Axiom. The third and final part of the paper examines the consistency strength of choiceless large cardinals, including a proof that assuming {DC}, the existence of an elementary embedding from \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+3\}\$ to \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+3\}\$ implies the consistency of {ZFC} + \$I\_0\$. By a recent result of Schlutzenberg, an elementary embedding from \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+2\}\$ to \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda+2\}\$ does not suffice.},

	abstract = {According to a theorem due to Kenneth Kunen, under {ZFC}, there is no ordinal [Formula: see text] and nontrivial elementary embedding [Formula: see text]. His proof relied on the Axiom of Choice ({AC}), and no proof from {ZF} alone is has been discovered.
            [Formula: see text] is the assertion, introduced by Hugh Woodin, that [Formula: see text] is an ordinal and there is an elementary embedding [Formula: see text] with critical point [Formula: see text]. And [Formula: see text] asserts that [Formula: see text] holds for some [Formula: see text]. The axiom [Formula: see text] is one of the strongest large cardinals not known to be inconsistent with {AC}. It is usually studied assuming {ZFC} in the full universe [Formula: see text] (in which case [Formula: see text] must be a limit ordinal), but we assume only {ZF}.
            We prove, assuming {ZF} [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] “[Formula: see text] is an even ordinal”, that there is a proper class transitive inner model [Formula: see text] containing [Formula: see text] and satisfying {ZF} [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] “there is an elementary embedding [Formula: see text]”; in fact we will have [Formula: see text] ⊆[Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] witnesses [Formula: see text] in [Formula: see text]. This result was first proved by the author under the added assumption that [Formula: see text] exists; Gabe Goldberg noticed that this extra assumption was unnecessary. If also [Formula: see text] is a limit ordinal and [Formula: see text]-{DC} holds in [Formula: see text], then the model [Formula: see text] will also satisfy [Formula: see text]-{DC}.
            We show that {ZFC} [Formula: see text] “[Formula: see text] is even” [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] implies [Formula: see text] exists for every [Formula: see text], but if consistent, this theory does not imply [Formula: see text] exists.},

	abstract = {Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations is a self-contained and unified handbook on mathematical analysis and its foundations. Intended as a self-study guide for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduatestudents in mathematics and a reference for more advanced mathematicians, this highly readable book provides broader coverage than competing texts in the area. Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations provides an introduction to a wide range of topics, including: algebra; topology; normed spaces; integration theory; topological vector spaces; and differential equations. The author effectively demonstrates the relationships between these topics and includes a few chapters on set theory and logic to explain the lack of examples for classical pathological objects whose existence proofs are not constructive. More complete than any other book on the subject, students will find this to be an invaluable handbook. For more information on this book, see http://math.vanderbilt.edu/ Key Features * Covers some hard-to-find results including: * Bessagas and Meyers converses of the Contraction Fixed Point Theorem * Redefinition of subnets by Aarnes and Andenaes * Ghermans characterization of topological convergences * Neumanns nonlinear Closed Graph Theorem * van Maarens geometry-free version of Sperners Lemma * Includes a few advanced topics in functional analysis * Features all areas of the foundations of analysis except geometry Combines material usually found in many different sources, making this unified treatment more convenient for the user * Has its own webpage: http://math.vanderbilt.edu},

	abstract = {The multiverse view in set theory, introduced and argued for in this article, is the view that there are many distinct concepts of set, each instantiated in a corresponding set-theoretic universe. The universe view, in contrast, asserts that there is an absolute background set concept, with a corresponding absolute set-theoretic universe in which every set-theoretic question has a definite answer. The multiverse position, I argue, explains our experience with the enormous diversity of set-theoretic possibilities, a phenomenon that challenges the universe view. In particular, I argue that the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and as a result it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for.},

Using cartoons, puzzles, and "ations to enliven his text, Rucker acquaints us with staggeringly advanced levels of infinity, delves into the depths beneath daily awareness, and explains Kurt Gödel's belief in the possibility of robot consciousness. In the realm of infinity, mathematics, science, and logic merge with the fantastic. By closely examining the paradoxes that arise, we gain profound insights into the human mind, its powers, and its limitations.
